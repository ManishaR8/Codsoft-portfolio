            <p>Hello! I'm Manisha Rathour, a passionate Frontend Developer and Designer with a keen eye for user-centric web experiences.</p>
        <p>My journey in the world of web development began with the curiosity to blend creativity and technology seamlessly. As a frontend enthusiast, I take pride in crafting digital spaces that not only look stunning but also deliver intuitive user interactions.</p>
        <p>With a solid foundation in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I have honed my skills to create responsive, pixel-perfect designs that adapt gracefully across devices. I believe in staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies, ensuring that my creations are not only visually appealing but also functionally modern.</p>
        <p>My experience extends to frameworks like React.js and Tailwind CSS, enabling me to build dynamic and engaging user interfaces. I take pride in my ability to transform complex ideas into elegant code structures and intuitive user interfaces.</p>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me exploring new design trends, sketching interface concepts, or diving into a good book. I thrive on challenges, and I'm excited to contribute my skills to projects that have a positive impact.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch. I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and create remarkable digital experiences together.</p>
